# A complicated coin flipper

At the height of desparation from joblessness, I asked r/developersIndia for advice.

I received a DM suggestion from a user who sounded arrogant from the "get-go".

He wanted to know "how good" I was.

I remained polite, and explained the projects I worked on, but bro wanted to know what problems I solved. Since my projects didn't solve any _actual_ problems, bro suggested a _complicated_ problem. I had to make a Flutter app to flip a coin. So I decided to make one.

Bro's requirements:  
[] Your objective is to actually toss a virtual coin.  
[x] A coin is a physical cylinder with mass, radius and height  
[] A force comes and tosses the coin  
[] It gets dropped into a gel of density  
[] Density of the medium is a parameter  

After bro listed all the requirements, I suggested using Gen AI to create a math function that takes the parameters into account to create a virtual coin, then using gestures/mouse input to flick the coin in some direction adding velocity to the coin. The coin falls into gel slowing down, finally touching the bottom.

[] _Ok man, you create a math function using Gen-AI_  
[?] _Do you have an engineering degree?_  

Anyway, alright, Steve Jobs. I'll do what I can do with my.. wait do I even have an engineering degree?
